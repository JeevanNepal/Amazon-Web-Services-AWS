RDS Security - Encryption:

    Data at rest Encryption:
      Possibility to encrypt the master & red replicas with AWS KMS - AES -256 Encryption.
      Encryption has to be defined at launch time.
      If the master is not encrypted, the read replica cannot be encrypted.
      Transparent data encryption (TDE)available for oracle and SQL.
      

  In Flight Encryption:
    > SSL certificate to encryption data to RDS flight.
    > Provide SSL options with trust certificate when connecting to database.
    
    To Enforce SSL:
        > POstgres SQL:  rds.force_ssl = 1 in the AWS RDS Console (Parameter group).
        > MYSQL:Within the DB.
            Grant Usage on * To mysqluser.

RDS Encryptions Operations:
 > Snapshots of the un-encrypted RDS database are un-encrypted.
 > Snapshots of the ncrypted RDS database are encrypted.
 > Can copy a snapshot into an encrypted one.
 
 
To encrypt an un-encrypted RDA Database:
    > Create a snapshot of hte un-encrypted RDS database.
    > Copyy a snapshot and enable encryption ofr the snapshot.
    > Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot.
    > Migrate the application to new database and delete the old database.


RDS Security - Netrowk & IAM:
   > Network Security:- 
        . RDS databse usually deploy within the private subnet, not in public one.
        . RDS security works by leveraging security groups(the same concept as EC2 instances), it controls which IP/security group can communicate with RDS.
        
        
        

        
Access Management:
  > IAM policies helps to control who can manage AWS RDS(through the RDS API).
  > Traditional username & password can be used to login to the database.
  > IAM base authentication can be used to login to RDS MYSQL & Postgres SQL.
  
  
 RDS Using IAM Authentication:
