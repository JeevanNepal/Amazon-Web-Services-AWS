AWS ElastiCache Overview:
------------------------

    . The same way RDS is to get managed relational database.
    . ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached.
    . Caches are in-memory with really high in performance & low latency. 
    . Helps reduce loads off of database for read intensive work load.
    . Helps make your application state less.
    . Writes scaling using sharding. (SHARDING: Sharding is a database architecture pattern related to horizontal partitioning — the practice of separating one table’s rows 
       into multiple different tables,known as partitions.)
    . Read scaling using read replicas.
    . Multi AZ with failover capability.
    . AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optmization,setup, configuration, minitoring, failover and recovery.
    
    
       
REDIS:
-----
    Redis, which stands for Remote Dictionary Server, is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store for use as a database, cache, message broker, and queue.


MEMCACHED:
---------
    Memcached is a general-purpose distributed memory-caching system. It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to 
    reduce the number of times an external data source must be read. Memcached is free and open-source software, licensed under the Revised BSD license.

 > Application queries ElastiCache, if not  available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache.
 > Helps relieve load in RDS.
 > Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most recent data is used on there.
    
    
    
 
ElastiCache Solution Architecture - User Session:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    > Users logs into any of the applications.
    > The application writes the session data into ElastiCache.
    > The user hits another instance of our application.
    > The instance retrives the data and the user is already logged in.
