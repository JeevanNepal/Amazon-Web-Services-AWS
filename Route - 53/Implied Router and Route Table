Implied Route and Routing Table:
It is a central routig function. It connects the different AZ together and connects the VPC to the intrnet getway.
We can have upto 200 route table per VPC. We can have pto 50 routes entries per route table.

Each subnet must be associated with only one route table at any given time.
If you do not specify a subnet to route thable association, the subnet will be associated with the default VPC route table.
We can also edit the main route table if it's needed, but we cannot delete main route table.
However you can make a custom route table manually, it becomes the main route table and the former route table can be deleted as it's no longer a main route table route,
You can associate multiple subnet with the same route table.

INTERNET GETWAY: 
An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It does not cause availability risks or
bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

An internet gateway enables resources in your public subnets (such as EC2 instances) to connect to the internet if the resource has a public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. Similarly, resources on the internet can initiate a 
connection to resources in your subnet using the public IPv4 address or IPv6 address. For example, 
an internet gateway enables you to connect to an EC2 instance in AWS using your local computer.

An internet gateway provides a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic. For communication using IPv4, the internet gateway also performs network address translation (NAT). For communication using IPv6, 
NAT is not needed because IPv6 addresses are public. For more information, see IP addresses and NAT.
