AWS Route 53 - Overview:
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Amazon route 53 is a highly available and scalable domain name system(DNS) web service. We can use it to reg  ister new domains, transfers existing domains, 
route traffic for our domains to our AWS and external resources and monitor the health of our resources
  
  Route 53 is a managed DNS(domain name system).
  DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps client understand how to reach a server through it's domain name.
  
  In, AWS most common records are:
    . A: hostname to IPv4.
    . AAAA: hostname IPv6
    . CNAME: hostname to hostname.
    . Alias: hostname to AWS resources.
    
    
  Route 53 can use:
   . public domain name we own(or buy).
   . private domain name that cna be resolved by our instances in our VPCs.
   
   
Route 53 has advanced features such as:
 . Load balancing(through DNS - also called as client balancing).
 . Health checks(although limited...)
 . Routing policy: simple, geolocation, failover, latency, weighted, multi value.
 . Traffic maintaining
 
 
 We have to pay $0.5 per month per hosted zone.

A generic top-level domain (gTLD) is a global extension that is used and recognized around the world. Generic top-level domains cover a thematic field, like .org for non-profit organizations and .biz for commercial businesses. 
The core group of generic top-level domains consists of the following: com, net, org, biz, info.
 
 
NOTE: Each amazon route 53 account is limited to a maximum of 500 hosted zones and 10000 resources record sets per hosted zone. We can increase this limit by requesting to AWS.

Deligate to Route 53:
------------------
COnnect the domain name to route 53 hosted zone - This is called deligation.

To delegate a subdomain to Amazon Route 53, you can: 
Create a hosted zone for the subdomain
Add records to the hosted zone for the subdomain
Create an NS record for the subdomain in the hosted zone for the domain
You can also create a delegation set, which is a group of four name servers that can be reused by multiple hosted zones. 
Route 53 is an authoritative DNS system that can be used for domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.
