++++++++++++++++++++++++

  Amazon route 53 is a highly available and scalable doain name system(DNS) web service.
  
  Route 53 is a managed DNS(domain name system).
  DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps client understand how to reach a srver through it's domain name.
  
  In, AWS most common records are:
    . A: hostname to IPv4.
    . AAAA: hostname IPv6
    . CNAME: hostname to hostname.
    . Alias: hostname to AWS resources.
    
    
  Route 53 can use:
   . public domain name we own(or buy).
   . private domain name that cna be resolved by our instances in our VPCs.
   
   
Route 53 has advanced features such as:
 . Load balancing(through DNS - also called as client balancing).
 . Health checks(although limited...)
 . Routing policy: simple, geolocation, failover, latency, weighted, multi value.
 
 
 We have to pay $0.5 per month per hosted zone.
