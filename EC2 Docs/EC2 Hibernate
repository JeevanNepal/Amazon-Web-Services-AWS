EC2 Hibernate:
    In the memory (RAM) state is preserved.
    The instance boot is much faster(the OS is not stopped or restarted).
    Under the hood: the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume.
    The root EBS volume must be encrypted.


Use Cases: 
     long running procrssing.
     saving the RAM state.
     servivces that takes long time to initialize.
