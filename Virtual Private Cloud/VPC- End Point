What is VPC Endpoint?
A VPC endpoint enables customers to privately connect to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink. Amazon VPC instances do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources of the service. 
Traffic between an Amazon VPC and a service does not leave the Amazon network.

VPC endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available Amazon VPC components that allow communication between instances in an Amazon VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on network traffic. 
There are two types of VPC endpoints:

interface endpoints

gateway endpoints
