AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN) establishes a secure and private tunnel from your network or device to the AWS Cloud. You can extend your existing on-premises network into a VPC,

AWS VPN offers two types of private connectivity that feature the high availability and robust security necessary for your data.
