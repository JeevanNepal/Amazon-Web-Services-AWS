What is virtual private cloud?
With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined.
This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

The following diagram shows an example VPC. The VPC has one subnet in each of the Availability Zones in the Region, 
EC2 instances in each subnet, and an internet gateway to allow communication between the resources in your VPC and the internet.

Features
The following features help you configure a VPC to provide the connectivity that your applications need:

Virtual private clouds (VPC)
A VPC is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center. After you create a VPC, you can add subnets. 
It has a benefit of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

Subnets
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. A subnet must reside in a single Availability Zone. After you add subnets, you can deploy AWS resources in your VPC.

IP addressing
You can assign IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6, to your VPCs and subnets. 
You can also bring your public IPv4 and IPv6 GUA addresses to AWS and allocate them to resources in your VPC, such as EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and Network Load Balancers.

Routing
Use route tables to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

Gateways and endpoints
A gateway connects your VPC to another network. For example, use an internet gateway to connect your VPC to the internet. 
Use a VPC endpoint to connect to AWS services privately, without the use of an internet gateway or NAT device.

Peering connections
Use a VPC peering connection to route traffic between the resources in two VPCs.

Traffic Mirroring
Copy network traffic from network interfaces and send it to security and monitoring appliances for deep packet inspection.

Transit gateways
Use a transit gateway, which acts as a central hub, to route traffic between your VPCs, VPN connections, and AWS Direct Connect connections.

VPC Flow Logs
A flow log captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

VPN connections
Connect your VPCs to your on-premises networks using AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN).

Getting started with Amazon VPC
Your AWS account includes a default VPC in each AWS Region. Your default VPCs are configured such that you can immediately start launching and connecting to EC2 instances. For more information, see Get started with Amazon VPC.

You can choose to create additional VPCs with the subnets, IP addresses, gateways and routing that you need. For more information, see Create a VPC.

Working with Amazon VPC
You can create and manage your VPCs using any of the following interfaces:

AWS Management Console — Provides a web interface that you can use to access your VPCs.

AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) — Provides commands for a broad set of AWS services, including Amazon VPC, and is supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux. For more information, see AWS Command Line Interface.

AWS SDKs — Provides language-specific APIs and takes care of many of the connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For more information, see AWS SDKs.

Query API — Provides low-level API actions that you call using HTTPS requests. Using the Query API is the most direct way to access Amazon VPC, but it requires that your application handle low-level details such as generating the hash to sign the request, 
and error handling. For more information, see Amazon VPC actions in the Amazon EC2 API Reference.

Pricing for Amazon VPC.
There's no additional charge for using a VPC. There are charges for some VPC components, such as NAT gateways, IP Address Manager, traffic mirroring, Reachability Analyzer, and Network Access Analyzer. For more information, see Amazon VPC Pricing.

Pricing for public IPv4 addresses

Public IPv4 addresses are charged. For specific pricing information, see the Public IPv4 address tab in Amazon VPC Pricing. Private IPv4 addresses (RFC 1918) are not charged.

Nearly all resources you launch in your VPC come with an IP address for connectivity. While the vast majority of resources in your VPC use private IPv4 addresses, resources that require direct access to the internet over IPv4 use public IPv4 addresses.

A public IPv4 address is an IPv4 address that is routable from the internet. A public IPv4 address is necessary for a resource to be directly reachable from the internet over IPv4.

The types of public IPv4 addresses are:

Elastic IP addresses (EIPs): Static, public IPv4 addresses provided by Amazon that you can associate with an EC2 instance, elastic network interface, or AWS resource.

EC2 public IPv4 addresses: Public IPv4 addresses assigned to an EC2 instance by Amazon (if the EC2 instance is launched into a default subnet or if the instance is launched into a subnet that’s been configured to automatically assign a public IPv4 address).

BYOIPv4 addresses: Public IPv4 addresses in the IPv4 address range that you’ve brought to AWS using Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).

Service-managed IPv4 addresses: Public IPv4 addresses automatically provisioned on AWS resources and managed by an AWS service. For example, public IPv4 addresses on Amazon ECS, Amazon RDS, or Amazon Workspaces.

Below is a list of most common AWS services that can use public IPv4 addresses.

Amazon AppStream 2.0

AWS Database Migration Service

Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Container Service

Amazon EKS

Amazon EMR

AWS Global Accelerator

AWS Mainframe Modernization

Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka

Amazon MQ

Amazon RDS

Amazon Redshift

AWS Site-to-Site VPN

Amazon VPC NAT gateway

Amazon WorkSpaces

Elastic Load Balancing


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once the VPC is ceated, we cannot change it's CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) block range.
If we need different CIDR size create new.
Different subnets within a VPC cannot overlap.We  can however expand VPC CIDR by adding new/extra iP addess ranges (except Govcloud and AWS China).
Maximun 5 vpcs can be created in 1 reason and 200 subnet in one VPC and 200 routing table.

We can allocate maximum 5 elastic IP in one account. By default, all AWS accounts are limited to five (5) Elastic IP addresses per Region, 
because public (IPv4) internet addresses are a scarce public resource.

Steps to create VPC:
Create a VPC
Create a subnet
internet getway
route table 



Subnet is availability zone specific and VPC is region specific.

NAT Getway is created in public subnet but used for private subnet.





Components of Amazon VPC:
Subnet: A subnet in VPC is something a range of IP addresses. It is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 services and shares a common address component. Public Subnet where resources are exposed to the internet through Internet Gateway and Private Subnet where resources are not exposed to the outside world.
Route Table: They are the set of rules used to decide where the network traffic has to be managed. It specifies the destination i.e IP address and target. The target can be Internet gateway, NAT gateway, Virtual private gateway, etc. With the use of route tables, users can determine where the network traffic will be directed from your subnet or gateway.
Virtual Private Gateway: It is the VPN(Virtual Private Network) hub on the Amazon side of the VPN connection to have a secure transaction. Users can attach it to the VPC from which they want to create the VPN connection.
NAT Gateway: Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway is used when higher bandwidth, availability with lesser management effort is required. It updates the routing table of the private subnet such that it sends the traffic to the NAT gateway. It supports only UDP, TCP, and ICMP protocols.
VPC Peering: A VPC peering connection allows you to route traffic between two Virtual Private Clouds using IPv4 or IPv6 private addresses. Users can create a VPC peering connection between their own VPC with a VPC in another AWS account. This connection helps you to smoothly transfer the data.
Security Groups: It consists set of firewalls rules that control the traffic for your sample. You can have a single security group associated with multiple instances.
Elastic IP: It is a static IP address which is a reserved public IP address that can be assigned to any Instance in a particular region and never changes.
Network Access Control Lists (NACL): It is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. It adds an additional layer of security to your VPC.
Customer Gateway: VPN connection links your network (or data) to your Amazon VPC (virtual private cloud). A customer gateway is a presenter on your side of that connection. It can be a physical or software appliance.
Network Interface: It’s a connection between private and public networks. Network traffic is automatically shifted to the new instance if you move it from one instance to the other.
VPC Endpoints: It allows VPC to make a connection with other services of AWS without using the internet. They are of two types, Interference endpoints, and  Gateway endpoints. They are scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components.
IP addressing: With the IP Addressing, you can assign your VPCs and subnets, the IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses.
