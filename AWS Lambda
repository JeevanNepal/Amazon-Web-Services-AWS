AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a compute service that allows users to run their own code without having to worry about servers.


The minimum memory that can be allocated to an AWS Lambda function is 128 MB. The maximum is 10,240 MB. The default setting for new functions is 128 MB. 
Memory can be configured for new or existing functions using the following tools: 
AWS Management Console
AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
AWS SDK
AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)
Memory allocation affects the performance of a Lambda function. Lambda allocates CPU power in proportion to the amount of memory configured. More CPU resources may decrease the duration of a Lambda function.


AWS Lambda functions can be configured to run up to 15 minutes per execution. You can set the timeout to any value between 1 second and 15 minutes.
