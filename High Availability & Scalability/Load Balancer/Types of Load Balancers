Types of Load Balancers in AWS.
   There are three types of losd balancer in AWS.

    1. Classic load balancer: (v1 - old generation) - 2009, supports - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP.
    2. Application load balancer: (v2 - new generation) - 2016, supports-  HTTP,HTTPS, Websockets.
    3. Network load balancer: (v2 - new generation) - 2017, supports - TCP, TLS (secure TCP) & UDP.

 Overall, it is recomemded to use the newer / V2 generation ;load balancers as they provide more features.
 
We can setup internal (private) or external (public) ELBs.


Load Balancers Important points to remember:
   Load balancer can scale but not instantaneously - cantact AWS for a warm-up.
    Trooubleshooting.
    4xx errors are client induced errors.
    5xx error are application errors.
    Load balancer error 503 means at capacity or no registered target.
    If the load balancer can't connect to your application then we need to check security groups.

Monitoring:
   ELB access logs will log all access requests(so we can debug per request).
   CloudWatch Metrics will give us aggregate statistics(ex. connection counts). 


CLASSIC LOAD BALANCER:
----------------------

   Support TCP (Layer 4), HTTP & HTTPS(Layer 7).
   Health checks are either TCP base or HTTP based.
   Fixed hostname.
   xxxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com



                  listener                                 internal
Client--------------------------------------- CLB -----------------------------------EC2


Hands On:

1. Go to load balancer at left side of the console.
2. Click on create load balancer,
3. For now we will use CLB as we are in classic load balancer.
4. Give the name there, "myfirstCLB"
5. Assign security groups.
6. Create a new security group.
7. Health Checks, 

Advanced Details:
   Response Timeout 
   10 seconds

   Interval 
   5 seconds

   Unhealthy threshold 
   2

   Healthy threshold 
   5

Click on add EC2 instances.
   Add the old instance > add tag > review and created and created.

If we run the DNS name in the browser it works as well.
Name: MyfirstCLB
DNS name: MyfirstCLB-1115348721.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com 


APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER:
-------------------------

   Application load balancer is layer 7 (HTTP)
   Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups).
   Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine (ex. containers).
   Support for HTTP/2 and Websockets.
   Support redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS).


Routing tables to different target groups:
   Routing based on path URL.
   Routing based on hostname in URL.
   Routing based on query string, headers(ex. example.com/user?ID).


ALB are great fit for micro services & container-based application(ex. Docker & Amazon ECS).
Has a port mapping features to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS.
In comparison we need multiple classic load balancer per application but for ALB one is enough for multiple 
application.
