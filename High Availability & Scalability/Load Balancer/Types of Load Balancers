   There are three types of losd balancer in AWS.

    1. Classic load balancer: (v1 - old generation) - 2009, supports - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP.
    2. Application load balancer: (v2 - new generation) - 20016, supports-  HTTP,HTTPS, Websockets.
    3. Network load balancer: (v2 - new generation) - 20017, supports - TCP, TLS (secure TCP) & UDP.

 Overall, it is recomemded to use the newer / V2 generation ;load balancers as they provide more features.
 
We can setup internal (private) or external (public) ELBs.


Load Balancers Important points to remember:
   Load balancer can scale but not instantaneously - cantact AWS for a warm-up.
    Trooubleshooting.
    4xx errors are client induced errors.
    5xx error are application errors.
    Load balancer error 503 means at capacity or no registered target.
    If the load balancer can't connect to your application then we need to check security groups.

Monitoring:
   ELB access logs will log all access requests(so we can debug per request).
   CloudWatch Metrics will give us aggregate statistics(ex. connection counts).
