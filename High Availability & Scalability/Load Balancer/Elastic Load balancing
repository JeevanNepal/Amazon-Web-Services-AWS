What is load balancing?
    Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers(EC2 instances) downstream.

Why we should use load balancer?
    Spread load across multiple downstream instances.
    Expose a single point of access(DNS) to our application.
    Simlessly handles failures of downstream instances.
    Do regular healthcheck to our instances.
    Provides SSL termination (HTTPS) to our websites.
    Enforce stickness with cookies.
    High availability across zones.
    Seperate public traffic from private traffic.

Why use an EC2 load balancer?
    An ELB(EC2 Load balancer) is a managed load balancer.
     . AWS gurantees that it will be working.
     . AWS takes care of upgrade, maintenance and high availability.
     . AWS provides only few configuration knobs.

It cost less to setup our own load balancer.

It is integrated with many AWS offrings/services.


Health Checks:
    Health checks are crucial to load balancer.
    They enable load balancer to know if the instances it forwards traffic to are availabil to reply to requests.
    Health checks is done on a port and route.
    If the response is not 200% (OK) then the instance is unhealthy.
