Scalability & High Availability:
    Scalability mean that an application/ system can handel greater load by adapting.

There are two kind of scalability:
    1) Vertical Scalability
    2) Horizontal Scalability(= elasticity)

Scalability is linked but different to high avabiality.


Vertical Scalability:
    It means the increasing the size of the instance.
    ex: from t2.micro to t2.large

    It is very common for ono distributed systems, such as a database.
    RDS, ElastiCache are services that can scale vertically.
    There is usually a limit to how much we can vertically scale(hardware limit).
