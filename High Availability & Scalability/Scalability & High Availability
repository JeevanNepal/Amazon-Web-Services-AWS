Scalability & High Availability:
    Scalability mean that an application/ system can handel greater load by adapting.

There are two kind of scalability:
    1) Vertical Scalability
    2) Horizontal Scalability(= elasticity)

Scalability is linked but different to high avabiality.


Vertical Scalability:
    It means the increasing the size of the instance.
    ex: from t2.micro to t2.large

    It is very common for ono distributed systems, such as a database.
    RDS, ElastiCache are services that can scale vertically.
    There is usually a limit to how much we can vertically scale(hardware limit).

Horizontal Scalability:
    It means increasing the number of instances/system for the application.
    It implies distributed system.
    This is very common for web application/ mordern application.


High Availability:
    It gors hand in hand wih Horizontal scalability but not all the time.
    It means running our application/system in at lease 2 data center(==avabiality Zone), to prevent the loss of data.


High Availability & Scalability for EC2:
    Vertical Scaling = increasing instance size(scale up/down).
    t2.nano(0.5RAM, 1 vCPU) to u12tbl.metal(12.3 TB RAM,448 vCPU).
