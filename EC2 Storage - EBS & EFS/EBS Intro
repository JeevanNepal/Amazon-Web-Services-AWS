What is an EBS (Elastic Block Store)?
    Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, high-performance, block-storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute 
    Cloud (EC2) for both throughput and transaction intensive workloads at any scale.

What is an EBS volume?
    An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances while they run. You can use EBS volumes as primary 
    storage for data that requires frequent updates, such as the system drive for an instance or storage for a database application.
    
    > An EC2 machine looses it's root volume(main drive) when it is manually terminated.
    > Unexpected termination may happen time to time(AWS would mail us anyway).
    > Sometimes, you need a way to store instance data somewhere.
    > It allows your instances to persist data.
    > It is a network drive (i.e not a physical drive).
        . It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means that there might be a bit of latency.
        . It can be detched from an EC2 instance and can be attached to another one quickly.
        
    > It is locked to an available zone(AZ).
        . An EBS volume in us-east-1 cannot be attached to us-east-2.
        . To move a volume across we first need a snapshot it. 
    
    > We need to provide a provisioned capacity(size in GBs and IOPs){(IOPS are a unit of measure representing input/output operations per second. 
             The operations are measured in KiB, and the underlying drive technology determines the maximum amount of data that a volume type counts as a single I/O.)}.
    
        . we will get billed for all the provisioned capacity, eg: if we provision 1TB and use 1 GB then we will still be billed for 1 TB.
        . we can increase the capacity of the drive over time.


EBS Volume Types:
   > Amazon EBS provides the following volume types, which differ in performance characteristics and price, so that you can tailor your storage performance and cost to
   the needs of your applications.
   The volumes types fall into these categories:

1.Solid state drives (SSD) — Optimized for transactional workloads involving frequent read/write operations with small I/O size, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS.

2.Hard disk drives (HDD) — Optimized for large streaming workloads where the dominant performance attribute is throughput.

3. Previous generation — Hard disk drives that can be used for workloads with small datasets where data is accessed infrequently and performance is not of primary importance.
We recommend that you consider a current generation volume type instead.


GP2 (SSD) -  General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads.
IO 1(SSD) -  HIghest performance SSD volume for mission-critical low- latency or high throughput workloads.
SD1(HDD) - Low cost volume defined for frequently accessed throughput intensive workloads.
SC1(HDD) - Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads.

EBS volume are characterised in size | Throughput  | IOPs (I/O ops per sec).
Only GP2 and IO 1 can be used as boot volumes.


The root device is /dev/nvme0n1. The attached volume is /dev/nvme1n1, which is not yet mounted.

[ec2-user ~]$ lsblk
NAME          MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme1n1       259:0    0  10G  0 disk
nvme0n1       259:1    0   8G  0 disk
-nvme0n1p1    259:2    0   8G  0 part /
-nvme0n1p128  259:3    0   1M  0 part



The following is example output for a T2 instance. The root device is /dev/xvda. The attached volume is /dev/xvdf, which is not yet mounted.

[ec2-user ~]$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0    8G  0 disk
-xvda1  202:1    0    8G  0 part /
xvdf    202:80   0   10G  0 disk


Use the file -s command to get information about a device, such as its file system type. If the output shows simply data, as in the following example output, 
there is no file system on the device and you must create one.

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
/dev/xvdf: data

EBS Volume Types Deep Dive:
     > GP2 (from AWS Docs) use cases:
     
        . Recomended for most workload.
        . System boot volume.
        . Virtual deskpot.
        . Low-latency interative apps.
        . Development and test environments.
        . Size can range from 1 GBi to 16TBi.
        . Small gp2 volumes can brust upto IOPs to 3000.
        . Max IOPs is 16000.
        . 3 IOPs / 1GB, means at 5334 GB we are at the max IOPs.
        

    >  IO1(from AWS Docs) use cases:
    
       . Used for critical applications that required sustained IOPS performance or more than 16000 IOPS per volume (gp2 limit).
       . Large database workload such as, mongodb, Cassandra, Microsoft SQL Server, mySql, postgres SQL, oracle.
       . Size can range from 4GB to 16TB.
       . IOPS is provisioned(PIOPS) - Min 100, Max 64000 {Nitro Instance(out of scope now)}, else Max 32000(for all other instances).
       . The maximum ration of provisioned IOPS to requested volume size (in GB) is 50:1. (Size (GiB)
            Size in GB: 10 (Min: 4 GiB, Max: 16384 GiB) 
            IOPS 600
            Size in GB: 600 (Min: 100 IOPS, Max: 64000 IOPS) 
            Maximum ratio of 50:1 is permitted between IOPS and volume size.)
