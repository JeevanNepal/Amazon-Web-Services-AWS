ssh on Mac/Linux    
ssh is one of the most important function. It allows you to control a remote machine, all using a command 
line.

ssh using putty on windows:
Putty does not accept the pem file format so we need to convert it using puttygen.exe software to 
putty private key (ppk file ) so putty can accepts it.

So to connect to putty everytime you log out of the AWS instance follow the below steps:
1. Start the ec2 instance.
2. Open putty and re-enter the IPv4 Public IP key and configure the putty by entering the ppk file.


Another way to use ssh key in windows through windown terminal:
Preety same way as the linux/Mac OS even for Windows.
