Public vs Private IP (IPv4):

Networking has two sorts of IPs: IPv4 & IPv6
IPv4 is the most common foemat used online.
IPv6 is newer and mostly used for Internet of Things(IOT).


Public vs Private IPs Fundamental Difference:
    Public IPs:
        1. Public Ip means that machine can be identified on the internet.
        2. Must be unique across the whole web(www).
        3. Can be geo-located easily.



    Private IPs:
        1. Machine can be only identified on privste network.
        2. IP muat be unique across private network.
        3. Two companies can have one common IP.
        4. Only a specified IP can be used as private IP.


 Elastic IPs:
    1. It is an IP of the instance which you can attache to one instance at a time.
    2. It is alive as long as the instance is running and it is dynamic in nature.
    3. It is a public IPv4 IP.
    4. Only 5 of it is provided but we can ask AWS to increase it but it's a rare case.

    With an elastic IP, we can mask the failure of an instance or software bby repidly remapping the address of 
    another instance.

Overall it's better avoiding using elastic IPs.
        1. They often reflect poor architectural decisions.
        2. Instead, better use a random public Ip and register a DNS name to it.DNS in AWS will be route 53.
