SQS stands for Simple Queue Service. 

It is a web service that provides access to a message queue. It was the first service available in AWS. 
Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that allows users to: 
Send: Messages between various software components
Store: Messages while waiting for a computer to process them
Retrieve: Multiple messages of various sizes asynchronously
Decouple: Microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications
Scale: Microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications
A single Amazon SQS message queue can contain an unlimited number of messages. However, there is a quota of 120,000 for the number of inflight messages for a standard queue and 20,000 for a FIFO queue.
