SQS stands for Simple Queue Service. 

It is a web service that provides access to a message queue. It was the first service available in AWS. 
Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that allows users to: 
Send: Messages between various software components
Store: Messages while waiting for a computer to process them
Retrieve: Multiple messages of various sizes asynchronously
Decouple: Microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications
Scale: Microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications
A single Amazon SQS message queue can contain an unlimited number of messages. However, there is a quota of 120,000 for the number of inflight messages for a standard queue and 20,000 for a FIFO queue.
SQS allows the decoupling of application components such that a failure in one components does not cause a bigger problen to application functionality.


In Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), visibility timeout is a time interval during which other consumers are prevented from receiving and processing a message. The purpose of visibility timeout is to prevent multiple consumers from consuming the same item repeatedly. 
The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds and the maximum is 12 hours. If a task takes longer than 30 seconds, the visibility timeout can be increased. 
Visibility timeout works as follows: 
SQS hands over a message to the consumer.
The consumer processes the message.
The consumer deletes the message from the kit.
If a message must be received only once, the consumer should delete it within the visibility timeout duration. Otherwise, it will be available for another consumer.


Types of Queue in SQS:
---------------------
Standard Queue:                                                                  | FIFO Queue
1. High (unlimited) throughput.                                                  |1. Limited throughput 300 tps but has all the capabilities of standard queue.
2. At least one delivery.                                                        |2. Exactly one processing
3. Best effort ordering.                                                         |3. Duplicacy not possible
                                                                                 |4. Strict ordering - first in first out.
