Security Groups are the fundamentals of the network security in AWS.
They control how traffic is allowed into and out of EC2 machine.
Allow, inbound & outbound ports.

If we face any time-out issue than it can be a security group issue. 
We can just have a check on ports and other stuffs insecurity group tab.



Security Group In Deeper:
In actual security groups in EC2 acts as a firewall.

Thet regulates the following:
1. Access to ports.
2. Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 & IPv6
3. Control of inbound networks (from other to the instance)
4. Control of outbound neteworks (from the instance to others).


Security groups can be attached to multiple instances & instance can have multiple security groups too.
It is always good to maintaine one separate security group for SSH access.
