IAM Introduction:
IAM (Identity & Access Management)

Whole AWS Security will be in IAM.
 1. Users
 2. Groups
 3. Roles

Root account should never be used (and shared).

IAM ia art the center of AWS.

            Users                                Group                               Roles
        It is only for users.              Contains users.          It is for machines.(Internal usage within AWS resources).

IAM has a global view.
Permissions are governed by Policies (JSON).
MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) can be setup.
IAM has predefined"managed policies".
It's always bets to give the minimal permission to users to do their jobs(least privilage principles). 

IAM is a private account and credentials should not be shared at any cost.


AMI?
    As we show, AWS comes with base images such as:
        Ubuntu
        Fedora 
        Redhat
        Windows
        ect ....

    These images can be customised at runtime using EC2 user data.

    That's an AMI - an image to use to creat our instances.
    AMIs can be built for linux or windows machines.

EC2 AMIs Hands On:
    First of all we will install apache:
        yum update -y: to update all thr packages.
        yum install httpd: apache server.
        systemctl start httpd
        systemctl enable httpd

         echo "Hello World" > /var/www/html/index.html
         curl localhost:80

Create an image of the esixting instance:
 

Cross Account AMI Copy.
